# Components

The core of _ActiveElement_ is its set of components. These components are intended to be used within _Rails_ views to reduce the amount of _HTML_ developers need to write, as well as standardizing the look and feel of your application. A typical admin application should need very little (if any) custom _HTML_. If custom _HTML_ is needed, the composable nature of the provided components allows for this.

See the individual documentation sections for each component, and visit the [Decorators](decorators.html) section to see how you can write composable partials to override the default data formatters as needed.
