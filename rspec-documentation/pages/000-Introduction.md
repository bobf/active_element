# Introduction

_ActiveElement_ provides a range of rich [components](components.html) for fast, painless development of front end applications, primarily intended for (but not limited to) building administration areas.

An [authorization framework](access-control.html) is provided, intended to work alongside existing frameworks such as [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise), [Pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit), and [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan).

## Highlights

* Feature-rich [forms](components/forms.html) including a powerful [JSON form field component](components/form-fields/json.html).
* Simple and secure [auto-suggest text search](components/form-fields/text-search.html) widgets.
* [Tables](components/tables.html) with built-in pagination and action buttons for viewing/editing/deleting records.
* [Decorators](decorators.html) for overriding default display fields with simple _Rails_ view partials.
* Automated [permissions](access-control/authorization/permissions.html) that can be applied to all application endpoints with minimal effort.
* Sensible defaults to help you build your application quickly while also allowing you to customize when needed.
* _ActiveElement_ attempts to provide a framework of familiar patterns that work with you instead of against you. It does not attempt to do everything for you and avoids behind-the-scenes magic where possible.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) styling with [customizable themes](themes.html).

See the [Setup Guide](setup.html) and browse the rest of the documentation for full usage examples.
